====== Migration from ApplicationServer or Standalone version ======
To migrate from an existing installation, you have to the following steps:
Stop the old service
Move the folder /opt/scm-server, if it exists
Install the package
Copy the content of your existing scm home directory to /var/lib/scm
Change the owner of the directory and all containing files to scm:scm (chown -R scm:scm /var/lib/scm)
Verify repositoryDirectory in /var/lib/scm/config/[git|hg|svn].xml], make sure they point to respective /var/lib/scm/repositories/[git|hg|svn] and not your old location. Otherwise the repository health check will fail.
Optional: Reapply changes to /opt/scm-server/conf/server-config.xml and /opt/scm-server/conf/logging.xml
Start scm-server (/etc/init.d/scm-server start)
